# Fintech Finder Pay

Fintech Finder Pay is an application that customers can use to find fintech professionals from a list of candidates, hire the candidate, and pay them in the cryptocurrency (Ethereum) on the personal Ethereum blockchain Ganache. The application uses the Streamlit library to provide a web application that will provide the user interface to conduct search for the preferred fintech pro and calculate the total value of the Etheruem transaction. The transaction will be digitally signed and will pay the fintech pro for their work on the Ganache blockchain.
